<h1>The merger specific</h1>

<h2>MITPU seems like an exclusive group to its members only. Are we limiting Oluulaa’s projects to MITPU members only?</h2>
By merging with Oluulaa, we are trying to break the notion that MITPU is an exclusive members-focused organization. We are still going to be focused on our members and their experience while doing external-focused programs and events. 

<h2>Is Oluulaa going to lose its identity and brand?</h2>
Oluulaa’s programs like Event Series and mentorship program will keep the “oluulaa” brand name. MITPU will maintain and own the brand identity and keep growing the “Oluulaa” brand.

<h2>Due to the merger, does the mission statement need to be changed/revised?</h2>
There is a unified mission statement that ties together the focuses of both organizations.
